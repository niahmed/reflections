When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Collaborating on a project or working on the same project from more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid pulling changes on a remote repo by another person without inspecting how the changes may affect your local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks allow you to clone a repo and easily link the original repo without making any changes to it. Clone allows you to copy a repo and would be used when you are working on your own project. Branch allows you to make create a different version of your repo and still keep you master intact. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to have all the changes of the remote available while working offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would have to use file share services like dropbox or google drive. It would be more difficult to track changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
